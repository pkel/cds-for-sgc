# CDS for SGC

In this repository you'll find examples for extracting relevant data
from the [Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)][cds] for application in
city governments. All examples are tailored for the city of Constance
and their [Smart Green City (SGC)][sgc] program.

To get started install the dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file
and read the Python notebooks. You may also try to run `make notebook`
to start the notebook server from a fresh virtual environment with all
the dependencies installed.
